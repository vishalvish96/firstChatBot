AI-Powered Personal Portfolio Chatbot (Gradio + LLaMA/Ollama)

This project is an AI chatbot that answers questions about Vishal Mandal using his LinkedIn PDF, summary, and a locally-running LLM (Ollama).
It runs on a clean Gradio chat UI and responds in real-time as if it were Vishal himself.

📌 Features

✅ Reads your LinkedIn profile PDF automatically

✅ Loads your personal summary from a text file

✅ Creates a system-level persona prompt

✅ Uses Ollama to run models locally (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, etc.)

✅ Chat interface built with Gradio

✅ Fully offline — no OpenAI API needed

✅ Fast, lightweight, private

🧠 How It Works

Your PDF profile is processed using PyPDF2

Your summary.txt is loaded

A system prompt is generated with your bio + LinkedIn data

The chatbot responds in the style of you (Vishal Mandal)

Gradio provides an easy interface to chat with yourself 😄

    bot_answer = response.get("message", {}).get("content", "Sorry, I couldn't generate a response.")
    return bot_answer
